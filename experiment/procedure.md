### Aim of the experiment: PLC On-Delay Timer Instruction

<strong>Aim</strong>: To understand the working of on-delay timer instruction in a programmable logic controller.

<p><strong>Procedure</strong>: In our experiment we wish to demonstrate the working of on-delay timer instruction.</p>

<ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Since inputs and outputs are less, 8-point input module and 8-point output module is sufficient, where CPU resides in slot 0, input module resides in slot 1 and output module in slot 2. </li>

<li>In our experiment, we want our motor to run for 20 seconds and for this purpose, timer on-delay instruction is used. Here, one switch is used to turn the motor ON or OFF. The working status of the motor is displayed using LEDâ€™s. when the motor is running ,
Motor ON LED will glow. When the motor is not running , Motor OFF LED will glow. When the motor has done timing , Done timing LED will glow. </li>

<li>Let us assign address for the input and output signals of the PLC: <br>
&nbsp;&#10147; Start (switch) : I:1/0 <br>
&nbsp;&#10147; Motor ON (LED) : O:2/1 <br>
&nbsp;&#10147; Motor OFF (LED) : O:2/2 <br>
&nbsp;&#10147; Done timing (LED) : O:2/3 <br>
&nbsp;&#10147; Motor : O:2/4 </li>

<li>Let us see the ladder diagram:

</li>

<li>In order to see how the on-delay timer instruction in a PLC works, click (toggle) the start switch and observe the timer instruction. Also, observe the LED and motor correspondingly. <br>
The following screen shot explains the operations:<br>

The above screen shot represents the default condition, i.e. when the switch is open.</li><br>

The above screen shot represents the condition when the switch is closed and timer is timing.

The above screen shot represents the condition when the timer is done timing.</li>
</ul>
